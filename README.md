# Vik Text Editor

Why another text editor? Well...
1. Do you use notepad shipped with Windows to edit your files and continuously spam the Tab key to indent stuff?
2. Do you have buttery fingers like mine and fumble to open cmd first try?
3. Do you hate to look at the jungle of files in your working folder and it creeps you out when you're trying to find the file you need and compile it?

**Fear Not**
Because Vik Text Editor is here to take care of you if your starting out to write programs and it makes it incredibly fast and easy.



# Features

 - Very lightweight and portable. Version with setup are in the making
 - Create, Edit, Compile and Run C, C++, Java and Python programs without going out of the editor
 - Minimal Interface and clutter free menu with necessary actions all laid out
 - Smart indenting.
 > **Note:** The **Smart Indent** feature is still in works and thus has some bugs for now when the caret position is changed with the mouse pointer. 
 > Also, You must have respective compilers for C/C++, Java and Python installed. They don't come  with the build.
